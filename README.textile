h2. YOURLS Cloud logs Plugin

Fixes the user IPs to point to the actual user instead of your cloud provider's infrastructure IPs
Cloudflare: This information is gathered from _CF-Connecting-IP_ and applied as a filter to _yourls_get_IP()_
Heroku: This information is gathered from _X-Forwarded-For_ and applied as a filter to _yourls_get_IP()_

h3. Why?

Because CloudFlare[1] uses a reverse proxy to fetch the content into it's CDN, the server will see the proxy IPs instead of the _real_ IP[2]
and Heroku has router infrastructure which shows up as the requesting IP instead of the client [3]

h3. Installation

# Fetch/pull/download the repo
# Copy the folder _cloud_logs_ into _YOURLS_ABSPATH/user/plugins_ where _YOURLS_ABSPATH_ is the location your YOURLS install is located in.
# Activate plugin on administrator interface.
# ???
# Accurate statistics, huzzah!
