h2. YOURLS CloudFlare Plugin

Fixes the user IPs to point to the actual user instead of the CloudFlare[1] CDN servers.
This information is gathered from _CF-Connecting-IP_ and applied as a filter to _yourls_get_IP()_

h3. Why?

Because CloudFlare[1] uses a reverse proxy to fetch the content into it's CDN, the server will see the proxy IPs instead of the _real_ IP[2]

h3. Installation

# Fetch/pull/download the repo
# Copy the folder _cloudflare_ into _YOURLS_ABSPATH/user/plugins_ where _YOURLS_ABSPATH_ is the location your YOURLS install is located in.
# Activate plugin on administrator interface.
# ???
# Accurate statistics with a reliable CDN, huzzah!
